Hello Jose,

My name is Jonathan Chancey and I am enthusiatic to have received an offer letter for the SSD Technical internship position. 

What are the next steps to accept the offer? 

Additionally, the 2nd attached document called "Greeting" mentions joining the My Intel Internship Facebook group, but that requires a WWID. At what point should I expect to given a WWID? 

Thank you,
Jonathan Chancey
